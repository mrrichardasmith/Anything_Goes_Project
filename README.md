# Anything_Goes_Project
A project space for collaboration and practicing skill gaps.

The aim of this project space is to provide a place to contribute pieces of the learning curve by practicing any skill that the collaborators wish to check off their list. It has a React base and therefore components can be added with or without routes. We do hope to create some reusable components, so that some of our more structured projects benefit from this free wheeling dumping ground for creativity.
